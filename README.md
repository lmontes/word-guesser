# Word Guesser

This repository contains the source code of a Python 3 library that can guess words from a sequence of unordered letters. The library uses an internal dictionary to validate the words, at this moment supports only spanish and english languages.

## Web application

To demonstrate the use of the library a simple web application has been created. This demo application can be tried in the [word-guesser web page](https://lmont.es/word-guesser). In the next image we can see a screen capture from the web application.

The application code is also located in this repository. The file  [index.html](index.html) contains all the frontend code.

The file [main.py](main.py) uses the library to implement a REST API that is used by the web application. That API is deployed as a [Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions) in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

In order to ease the deployment of the API as a cloud function the code can be packaged as a zip file. We can use the [create-zip.sh](create-zip.sh) script to do it. When this script is executed it creates a file called **bundle.zip** with all the necessary file structure.

The tested cloud function configuration is:

* **Runtime**: Python 3.8
* **Memory**: 256 MiB
* **Executed function**: cloud_function
